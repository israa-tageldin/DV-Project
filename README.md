# **Smart Football Scouting: A Data-Driven Approach to Predicting FIFA Player Value**
### Football player value is shaped by more than skill alone. This project uses FIFA datasets to explore how performance, skills, age, and potential influence market value.
### Visual storytelling is used to uncover patterns in player data, followed by a machine learning model to predict market value, together supporting data-driven scouting decisions.
